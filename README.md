## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Prerequisites:** You'll need:

- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free)
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) **or** OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- A [Brave Search API key](https://brave.com/search/api/) (for the Search app)
- Docker installed on your computer

> **Note:** This setup uses pre-built Docker images from GitHub Container Registry for fastest deployment.

### Step 1: Get Your Accounts Ready

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Note your project URL and API key
2. **Get an OpenRouter API key** at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   - Sign up and generate an API key

### Step 2: Set Up the Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-supabase.sql` (from this repository)
3. Run the script - this creates all the necessary tables

### Step 3: Launch the Apps

```bash
# Download the apps
git clone https://github.com/neooriginal/OMI.me-Apps.git
cd "OMI.me-Apps"

# Configure your settings
cp docker.env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your information:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=any_random_string_here
FRONTEND_URL_BRAIN=http://localhost:3000
```


```bash
# Start everything (pulls pre-built images automatically)
docker-compose up -d
```

**That's it!** Docker will automatically download the pre-built images and start your apps:

- **Brain:** http://localhost:3000
- **Friend:** http://localhost:5000
- **Jarvis:** http://localhost:8000
- **Search:** http://localhost:5100

## üîß Advanced Options

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation (Not Recommended)</summary>

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can build and install each app manually (requires more setup):

**Requirements:** Node.js v16+, npm

```bash
# For each app (Brain, Friend, Jarvis)
cd Brain  # or Friend, or Jarvis
npm install

# Create .env file with your settings
SUPABASE_URL=your_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
PORT=3000  # 5000 for Friend, 8000 for Jarvis

# Start the app
npm start
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Run Individual Apps (Alternative Method)</summary>

You can also run individual apps directly using pre-built images:

```bash
# Run individual apps with pre-built images
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/neooriginal/omi.me-apps/brain:latest
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/neooriginal/omi.me-apps/friend:latest
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/neooriginal/omi.me-apps/jarvis:latest
```

This method gives you more control over individual services but Docker Compose is recommended for most users.
