      <p>
        omi search is an independent community integration and is <strong>not</strong> an official omi product. you are solely responsible for deciding whether it meets your requirements. by enabling the webhook you agree that you assume the entire risk of using this service.
      </p>

      <p>
        how data flows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>transcript segments arrive from your omi device/webhook and are buffered in memory for short-lived analysis windows.</li>
        <li>conversation snippets are only persisted if they are stored alongside a search suggestion inside your own <code>search_queries</code> table.</li>
        <li>queries sent to the brave api include the generated search text only‚Äîno raw transcripts, personal identifiers, or authentication tokens are forwarded.</li>
        <li>all persistence lives inside your supabase instance under your control; disabling or deleting the app stops further collection.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        deletion controls:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>delete individual search rows via the dashboard actions.</li>
        <li>use the ‚Äúdelete all saved search data‚Äù control to purge every stored suggestion for your uid.</li>
        <li>removing the webhook subscription or revoking supabase access prevents new data from being captured.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        exclusions of responsibility:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>no warranty of accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or usefulness of any generated search suggestion.</li>
        <li>no guarantee that transcripts or metadata will remain confidential; you must secure your supabase project, browser, and network.</li>
        <li>no assurance of uptime, error-free operation, or ongoing maintenance. outages, bugs, and data loss can occur.</li>
        <li>no liability for compliance obligations (gdpr, hipaa, or other regulations). you are responsible for meeting any legal or contractual requirements.</li>
        <li>no protection against misuse: do not process sensitive, medical, financial, or safety-critical information with this tool.</li>
        <li>no responsibility for third parties: brave search, supabase, openai, or any other dependency may change behavior, pricing, or retention policies without notice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        this software is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù without warranties of any kind, express or implied. by using it you acknowledge that results are experimental, that deletion controls rely on your supabase credentials, and that you must audit integrations regularly to ensure they behave as intended.
