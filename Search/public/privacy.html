        omi search is an independent community integration and is <strong>not</strong> an official product from omi or
        omi labs. use it at your own discretion and review this policy carefully before enabling the webhook.
      </p>

      <p>
        the integration receives transcript segments from your omi device, buffers them temporarily to detect useful
        topics, and only forwards minimal excerpts to the brave search api when a query is triggered. transcripts are
        not permanently stored unless they are attached to a search record in your supabase project.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>conversation snippets tied to search results are saved under your uid inside the <code>search_queries</code> table.</li>
        <li>you can delete individual searches from the dashboard or remove the app to stop further processing.</li>
        <li>cadence controls let you throttle how often new searches run.</li>
        <li>only the generated search text is sent to brave‚Äîno full transcripts or personal identifiers are shared.</li>
      </ul>
